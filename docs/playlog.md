## Summary
Wheelin’ is a fast paced, reflex based, 2D endless runner where the player is a color wheel rolling on a track. They interact with obstacles depending on how the player can match the wheel’s colors with that obstacle.

## Playtest Rules and Parameters
### Win Condition
The game is endless, so you win by getting a higher score than the previously highest score. 

### Gameplay
The player is a rolling wheel
If the wheel is rolling on the ground:
- Player can jump with the circle button
- If the wheel is in the air:
- Player can tilt forward with the ‘→’  button
- Player can tilt backwards with the ‘←’ - button
- Player can force themselves back down with the ‘↓’ button

- Players can orient themselves so that if their color matches the obstacle color, they bounce on it. Otherwise, they die

## What Happened During the Playtest
### What was working?
I got the bouncing mechanics to work, I also got the wheel to spin correctly. The obstacles show up in random order. The game keeps track of the score reasonably well. 

### What is not working as I intend it (Challenges to be solved?) 
I think I assumed because there were very few mechanics (only 4 buttons), that it would be simple to demonstrate. This gave me the idea to include a title screen demonstrating the controls so that players can figure out how to move before they play the game.

### What will I try next? 
I need to add speed variance
