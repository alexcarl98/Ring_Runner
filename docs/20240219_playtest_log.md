## Summary
*Two Sentences: What your game is. What are your design values. This should be your elevator pitch.*

Ring Runner is a fast paced, reflex based, 2D endless runner where the player is a donut rolling on a track. They interact with obstacles where playerâ€™s movements in response determine the game outcome.

## Playtest Rules and Parameters

### The Win Condition
There is no win condition in this game. It's a challenge of endurance for the player, survive as long as possible. 

### Actions
The player is a donut rolling on a track. While rolling on the ground, the player can jump. While in the air, the player may orient themselves forward or backwards and move faster in the downward direction. 

### Obstacles and Objects
The player must evade obstacles and survive for as long as possible:
- **Springs** Jumping on springs with the same color as donuts icing will give the player an extra jump
- **Spikes** If you land on a spike, you die. 
- **NOT YET IMPLEMENTED-Ramps** Rolling down a ramp will speed the player up and give them some air time. 
- **NOT YET IMPLEMENTED-Platforms** can jump onto platforms with springs. Platforms and ramps go hand in hand.
- **NOT YET IMPLEMENTED-Coins** Thinking of having coins to help guide the player

## What Happened During the Playtest
After some adjustments, I had a friend of mine (who never played it before) try it out with the new controls. It seems like they were able to grasp it fairly well. I also started the game out with a single color donut, rather than the dual colored donut. 


### What was working? 
I think I'm going to stick with the new controls for now. The spikes were also starting to work 

### What is not working as I intend it (Challenges to be solved?) 


### What will I try next? 
I'm going to have some other people playtest the game. 
- I think I might take out the rule where you need to land and orient yourself to match the spring color. I might keep something color based (i.e. you need to have the color to actually jump on the spring) but I'll make the colors collectable throughout the level. I'll make te 
- Still need to add the logic for spikes. 
- Considering adding coins. This might help guide the player especially in the tutorial phases so that they can get a better sense of how they should move.
- I'm thinking about having some new springs. Some white springs that you can jump on anytime. rather than starting out red, you start out white, the red springs will be introduced later.
